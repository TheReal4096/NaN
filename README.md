# NaN
To celebrate 25 games, I decided to remake Game #19 and rename it from 'Lose to Win' to NaN (again).
NaN tiles spawn and cannot merge.
To still have to fill up the board to win tho.
If you start with wrong tiles, click 'New Game' or press SPACE.
Made for clelebration. [Play it here!](https://thereal4096.github.io/NaN/)
